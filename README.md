# Simple implementation of the MVC framework
The MVC framework is divided into three parts：
1、The view layer displays data.
2、The model layer represents the core of application.
3、The controller layer processes the input.
This case has 2 models,one is used to display datas and the other is used to summarize datas.  And there is one entry page in each MVP framework ——index.php.
